                    The Breadwinner is a 2017 animated film set in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, focusing on an 11-year-old girl named Parvana. After her father is unjustly imprisoned, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her family, since women and girls are forbidden from going out alone. She teams up with a friend, Shauzia, who is also passing as a boy, and together they take on difficult jobs to survive. The film powerfully explores courage and resilience in the face of oppression, with Parvana using storytelling as a means to inspire hope. Directed by Nora Twomey and based on Deborah Ellisâ€™s novel, the movie uses striking animation to portray life under Taliban rule. The Breadwinner was acclaimed for its emotional depth and received several award nominations, including an Oscar for Best Animated Feature.
